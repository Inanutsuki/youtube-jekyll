    Welcome to your Day 13 Dedicate practice! The ultimate brain and body yoga practice!
---
This 21 min integrative session is designed to bring a gentle opening to all parts of the body... and to your mind too.  

Pro tip: use your breath. 

It is through this type of practice that we begin to settle into the experience of our yoga, instead of residing in our constant ambition to ‘get it right.’

This is also the perfect elixir for our inevitably strong and ever-surfacing desire to get instant results.  

Be sure to read today's corresponding Dedicate email! 

Let me know how you are feeling in the comment section down below!

Namaste.
